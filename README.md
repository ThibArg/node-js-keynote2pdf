node-js-keynote2pdf
===================

A node.js module which receives a zipped Keynote presentation (a path to a zip file), converts it to pdf (well, asks Keynote to convert it), and returns the pdf.

#### Two main points:

1. Will **work only on Mac OS**,
2. and **only with Keynote installed**

Tested with Mac OS X.9 Mavericks

### Main Principles
This module is quite simple: Receives a .zip, returns a .pdf. It assumes the .zip is a keynote presentation. Here is the main flow:
* Conversion:
  * Unzip the received file
  * Call an AppleScript to tell Keynote to export it to PDF
  * Send back the pdf in the callback
  * (all this being done asynchronously)
* Cleanup of the files (.key package, result .pdf) every 5 minutes by default
* The callback receives the regular (error, data) parameters (see below)

### Important: Dependencies
Modules to install on your node server:

	npm install node-uuid
	npm install adm-zip
	npm install applescript

### API

* **`configure`**`(inConfig)`: `inConfig` is an object with the following, optionnal properties:
  * `cleanup_timeout`
    * Every `cleanup_timeout` ms, the module will delete previous files created by the conversions.
    * Default value: 300000 (5 minutes)
  * `max_lifespan`
    * (Milliseconds)
    * When you don't explicitely call canClean() after a succesful conversion, temporary files are not deleted. To void flooding the disk, files are deleted if they were created since more than max_lifespan.
    * You must think about specific and probably rare usecase where either Keynote is very loaded, or a very, very big presentation is veing converted and the conversion takes a lot of time, so you want to avoid accidental removal of temporary file that is infact used. One hour seams to be good.
    * Default value: 3600000 (one hour)
  * `debug`
    * More or less info messages in the console
    * Default value is `false`

* **`getInfo`**`()` returns an object containing the configuration and other info:
  * `config`, with `cleanup_timeout`, `max_lifespan`, `debug`, ...(possibly others) properties
  * `conversion_folder`: The full path to the conversion folder
  * `stats`
    * `conversions`: The total count of calls to handleRequest
    * `conversions_ok`: The count of succesful requests (pdf was returned to the client)

* **`convert`**`(inZipFilePath, inCallback)` is the main API
  * `inZipFilePath` is the full path to a .zip file containing the Keynote presentation
  * `inCallback(inError, inData)`
    * When there is no error:
      * `inError` is `null`
      * `inData` has the following properties:
        * `uid`: A unique (string) identifier, to easily identify misc. requests when several are handled concurrently
        * `step`: A string telling what is the current step (unzipping the file, converting, sending the pdf)
          * Possible values are "Unzipping the file", "Converting the file" and "Done"
          * Constants are provided: `keynote2pdf.k.STEP_UNZIP`, `keynote2pdf.k.STEP_CONVERT` and `keynote2pdf.k.STEP_DONE`
        * `pdf`: Full path to the pdf, result of the conversion. This property is null as long as `step` id not `keynote2pdf.k.STEP_DONE`
    * When an error occured:
      * `inError` is not `null` and its `message` field contains the description of the problem
      * Ã¬nData` has the following properties:
        * `uid`: A unique (string) identifier, to easily identify misc. requests when several are handled concurrently
        * `errorLabel`: As its name states. Very often, it will be the same as `inError.message`

### Setup and Examples
* Run only on Mac OS. Was developed under Mavericks (Mac OS X.9.n)
  * (if used on Windows/Linux, it just returns an error and does nothing)
* Install Keynote on the Mac
* (install nodejs)
* Install the required external modules, if not yet installed on your server:

    ```
    npm install node-uuid
    npm install adm-zip
    npm install applescript
    ```

* Well. Also install this module, `npm install keynote2pdf` 
* See the `kn2pdf-usage-example-01.js` example to see how to use the module

### Interesting Information

This module was developed as part of [nuxeo-keynote](https://github.com/ThibArg/nuxeo-keynote), a plug-in for [Nuxeo](http://nuxeo.com), which detects a zip file contains a Keynote presentation, then calls this nodejs server and handles the returned pdf (full text index and preview of the pdf in the browser)

(yes. It _is_ interesting)
